# Event Loop Error Fix: "no running event loop"

## Problem
The application was failing to start with the error:
```
Failed to start application: no running event loop
RuntimeError: no running event loop
```

The error was occurring when trying to create asyncio tasks in a Qt/PySide6 application.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Asyncio in Qt Application
- The `CredentialMonitor` class was using `asyncio.create_task()` in the GUI thread
- Qt applications run their own event loop, not an asyncio event loop
- Line 99: `asyncio.create_task(self.check_all_credentials())` was failing

### 2. Mixed Event Loop Paradigms
- **Qt Timer**: `self.monitor_timer.timeout.connect(self.check_all_credentials)` (line 75)
- **Async Method**: `async def check_all_credentials(self)` couldn't be connected to Qt signals
- **Asyncio Tasks**: Trying to create tasks without an asyncio event loop running

### 3. Unnecessary Async Design
- All credential validation methods (`validate_jira_credentials`, etc.) are synchronous
- The async nature was adding complexity without providing any benefit
- No actual asynchronous I/O operations were being performed

## Solution Implemented

### Converted All Async Methods to Synchronous

**1. Fixed Timer Connection**:
```python
# Before (broken):
self.monitor_timer.timeout.connect(self.check_all_credentials)  # async method

# After (working):
self.monitor_timer.timeout.connect(self._on_timer_check)  # sync wrapper
```

**2. Added Sync Timer Handler**:
```python
def _on_timer_check(self):
    """Handle QTimer timeout for credential checks."""
    try:
        self.check_all_credentials()
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Error during scheduled credential check: {e}")
```

**3. Converted Async Methods**:
- `async def check_all_credentials()` → `def check_all_credentials()`
- `async def _check_credential()` → `def _check_credential()`
- `async def _perform_health_check()` → `def _perform_health_check()`
- `async def _attempt_auto_refresh()` → `def _attempt_auto_refresh()`
- `async def _refresh_*_credentials()` → `def _refresh_*_credentials()`

**4. Removed Asyncio Dependencies**:
- Removed `import asyncio`
- Removed all `await` keywords
- Changed `asyncio.create_task()` to direct method call

### Key Changes Made

```python
# Before:
async def check_all_credentials(self):
    for service, cred_type in credentials_to_check:
        await self._check_credential(service, cred_type)
        
# After:
def check_all_credentials(self):
    for service, cred_type in credentials_to_check:
        self._check_credential(service, cred_type)
```

## Files Modified
- `/src/wes/core/credential_monitor.py` - Converted all async methods to sync

## Verification
✅ CredentialMonitor can be created without errors  
✅ start_monitoring() works without asyncio error  
✅ check_all_credentials() works synchronously  
✅ Qt timer integration works properly  
✅ Main window initializes without event loop errors  
✅ All credential validation functionality preserved  

## Impact
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing API calls work the same way
- **Qt Compatible**: Properly integrates with Qt's event loop system
- **Simplified Design**: Removed unnecessary async complexity
- **Performance**: No change in actual performance (was never truly async)
- **Reliability**: Eliminates event loop conflicts

## Testing
The fix was validated by:
1. Testing CredentialMonitor initialization
2. Testing start_monitoring() without errors
3. Testing direct method calls
4. Testing main window creation
5. Verifying Qt timer integration works

Both the original configuration error and the event loop error are now resolved. The application can start successfully with a properly integrated credential monitoring system.

## Design Notes
This change represents a simplification of the design. The original async implementation provided no actual benefit since:
- All underlying operations were synchronous
- No network I/O was truly asynchronous
- Qt's signal/slot system works better with synchronous methods
- Credential checking is inherently a blocking operation (network requests)

The new synchronous design is more appropriate for a Qt application and eliminates the event loop complexity entirely.
