# Design: Set "Include Comments" to Default to True

## Overview
Currently, the "Include comments" checkbox in the application settings defaults to `False`. This design outlines the changes needed to make it default to `True`.

## Current State
- In `app_settings_page.py` line 77: `self.include_comments = self._create_checkbox("Include comments", False)`
- The orchestrator always passes `include_comments=True` when fetching Jira data (hardcoded)
- The app settings value is not currently being used by the orchestrator

## Design Approach

### Option 1: Simple UI Default Change (Recommended)
**Changes Required:**
1. Update `app_settings_page.py` line 77 to set default to `True`
2. Update line 222 to also default to `True` when loading config

**Pros:**
- Minimal change (2 lines)
- User preference is preserved in saved configurations
- Aligns with current orchestrator behavior

**Cons:**
- Only affects new installations

### Option 2: Configuration Migration
**Changes Required:**
1. Same as Option 1, plus:
2. Add a configuration migration to update existing configs
3. Version the configuration schema

**Pros:**
- Updates existing installations
- Provides a pattern for future config changes

**Cons:**
- More complex implementation
- Requires config versioning system

### Option 3: Make Orchestrator Respect App Settings
**Changes Required:**
1. Update orchestrator to read include_comments from app settings
2. Remove hardcoded `include_comments=True` 
3. Update UI default to `True`

**Pros:**
- Makes the setting actually functional
- Users can disable comment fetching if desired

**Cons:**
- Requires more extensive changes
- May break existing behavior expectations

## Recommended Implementation

Go with **Option 1** for immediate fix, as it:
- Provides the requested default behavior
- Is the simplest change
- Maintains backward compatibility

## Implementation Details

### File: `src/wes/gui/unified_config/config_pages/app_settings_page.py`

**Line 77:**
```python
# Change from:
self.include_comments = self._create_checkbox("Include comments", False)
# To:
self.include_comments = self._create_checkbox("Include comments", True)
```

**Line 222:**
```python
# Change from:
self.include_comments.setChecked(app_config.get("include_comments", False))
# To:
self.include_comments.setChecked(app_config.get("include_comments", True))
```

## Testing
1. Delete or rename existing config file
2. Start application
3. Navigate to Settings â†’ Application Settings
4. Verify "Include comments" is checked by default
5. Save settings and restart
6. Verify setting persists

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing Option 3 to make the setting functional
- Add configuration versioning for future migrations
- Document the relationship between app settings and orchestrator behavior
