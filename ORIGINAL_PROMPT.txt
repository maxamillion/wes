 Assume you are a Senior Principal software engineer at a S&P 500 company. Your task is to create a Product Requirement Document and Implementation Plan for a simple cross platfrom desktop application written in python using the pyside framework targeting macOS, Windows, and Linux. The primary purpose of the application is to allow an Executive Director to create an Executive Summary of the activities of their entire organization. The application automates the creation of weekly executive summaries by gathering data from Jira, using Google's Gemini AI for summarization, and creating a draft Google Doc of the summary. The query to Jira should allow for a configurable time frame worth of activity from a configurable list of users, then send the raw data to Gemini for summarization. The query to Jira should default to the previous week worth of activity but be configurable by the user. Ensure the implementation plan enforces a test driven development process using the pytest testing framework and use of best practices as it pertains to golang development and application security. Also, the python development environment should be managed with the uv utility. There should also be a Makefile that automates the build process to create single binaries for all supported platforms via the pyinstaller tool.
