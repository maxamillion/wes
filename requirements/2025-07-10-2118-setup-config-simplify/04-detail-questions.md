# Detailed Requirements Questions

Based on the codebase analysis, here are specific questions about the unified configuration implementation:

## Q1: Should the unified dialog use a sidebar navigation (like modern settings) instead of tabs/wizard pages?
**Default if unknown:** No (tabs and wizard navigation are familiar patterns in the existing codebase)

## Q2: Should we preserve the "Test Connection" functionality for each service in the unified interface?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (connection testing is critical for user confidence and troubleshooting)

## Q3: Should the unified dialog remember which advanced sections were expanded between sessions?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (respects user preferences and improves efficiency for power users)

## Q4: Should we keep the modal behavior for first-time setup to ensure completion?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (prevents users from using the app with incomplete configuration)

## Q5: Should service-specific settings (Jira/Google/Gemini) remain in separate sections or be merged into functional groups?
**Default if unknown:** No (keep service separation for clarity and maintainability)
